    <p class="text-muted text-left">The library in Sishu Griha is always quiet as libraries are always quiet. We have many books on many topics such as comedy, fiction and even books that are based on making yourself a better person. We want to teach our kids about how imporant books are and the best part is that they enjoy them very much. We also want to make our children know that books take us to different worlds where your imagination is creating fantasies in the head. We all know that knowledge is important.</p></div>

        <p class="text-muted text-left">The school auditorium in Sishu Griha has been the room where the children have been most excited. It is, by far, the room in which everybody relaxes and enjoys. We watch our movies there and we also often watch educational movies. The children laugh and enjoy very much. The teachers put the people in the auditorium because it either is a school program or we want our children to rest, lay back and relax. Everybody cheers when the teacher says that it is finally our turn to visit the auditorium. This is our enjoyment place.</p></div>

        <p class="text-muted text-left"> Our science lab is very big. It is where our children learn about chemical operations to make something new. Science is now split in to three things: Chemistry, Physics and Biology. Biology is everything connected to living beings on planet Earth (our home planet among trillions of planets) Our science lab is very much like a classroom where we learn stuff about Chemistry and Biology. Physics is more like maths but still needs a laboratory for its own. The science lab is our learning hub.
